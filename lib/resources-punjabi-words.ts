/* WHAT "COUNSELLING" MEANS IN PUNJABI — added 17 Sep 2026 from Search Console.
 *
 * The export showed a cluster nobody had written for and the site was already
 * near the top of anyway:
 *
 *   counselling meaning in punjabi      39 impressions   position 11
 *   counselling in punjabi              14               position 12.6
 *   burnout meaning in punjabi          11               position 7.7

 *   punjabi counselling                  4               position 14.5
 *   punjabi therapist near me            2               position 7
 *
 * Roughly seventy impressions a quarter, ranking on page one or two, and zero
 * clicks — because the page Google was showing is /punjabi, whose title is in
 * Gurmukhi. Somebody typing "counselling meaning in punjabi" in English wants a
 * meaning, in English, and cannot tell from that result that they will get one.
 *
 * This is not a keyword page. The question behind it is real and this practice
 * is unusually placed to answer it: two counsellors work in Punjabi, and the
 * single most common obstacle they describe is that the English clinical words
 * have no clean Punjabi equivalent, so a family ends up arguing about "ਪਾਗਲ"
 * when nobody meant anything of the sort. Explaining that is useful whether or
 * not the reader ever books.
 *
 * Every Gurmukhi term here is one already used in the site's existing Punjabi
 * pages (lib/punjabi-guides.ts, lib/practitioner-pa.ts) — the spellings are not
 * invented for this page.

      'There is no single Punjabi word that means what English means by counselling, and that gap is doing more damage in more families than any of the words themselves.',
    shortAnswer:
      'Counselling is most often said in Punjabi as ਕਾਊਂਸਲਿੰਗ (kaunsling), the English word written in Gurmukhi, or as ਸਲਾਹ-ਮਸ਼ਵਰਾ (salah-mashwara), which means consultation or taking advice. Neither is exact: the first is borrowed and the second suggests someone telling you what to do, which is not what a counsellor does. Related words are ਮਾਨਸਿਕ ਸਿਹਤ (mansik sehat, mental health), ਚਿੰਤਾ (chinta, worry or anxiety), ਉਦਾਸੀ (udaasi, low mood), ਤਣਾਅ (tanaa, stress) and ਥਕਾਵਟ (thakavat, exhaustion, which is how burnout is usually described). The word most families fear is ਪਾਗਲ (paagal, mad) and it has nothing to do with any of this.',

      { q: 'What is burnout in Punjabi?', a: 'There is no clinical term. It is described as ਥਕਾਵਟ (thakavat), exhaustion, and sometimes as ਤਣਾਅ (tanaa), stress. Both place it in the body rather than the mind, which is often how it is first noticed and which makes it easier to say out loud at home.' },
      { q: 'Is there a Punjabi word for depression?', a: 'Not an everyday one. ਉਦਾਸੀ (udaasi) means sadness or low mood, and it is the word most people use, but it sounds like something that will lift on its own. That mismatch is one reason a depressive episode in a Punjabi-speaking family is often heard as ordinary sadness for a long time before anybody treats it as more.' },
      { q: 'Do I have to speak Punjabi in the session?', a: 'No. Most people move between Punjabi and English in the same sentence, and that is normal here rather than something to apologise for. You can also book in English entirely and switch when a word only exists in one of them.' },
      { q: 'Who provides counselling in Punjabi at Westpeak?', a: 'Savneet Singh, a Registered Clinical Counsellor who works in Punjabi and English. Sessions are online, anywhere in British Columbia, and the first 30-minute consultation is free.' },
      { q: 'Will my family find out?', a: 'No. What is said in a session is confidential, with the narrow legal exceptions every counsellor has — a serious risk of harm, abuse of a minor, or a court order. Those are explained plainly at the first meeting. Nothing goes to family, community or an employer.' },
